# Col\*Lab

This is the code for my final web programming project and my first AJAX website.

Col\*Lab is a multidisciplinary project collaboration system for college and university students. It will enable students to work together on group projects online and help teachers to track their students' progress and monitor individuals' contributions.

This project was motivated by the logistical problems posed by assigning out-of-class group work. Students have difficulty finding common free time to work together, but teachers are able to cover less content if they allot class time to group work. Plus, it is difficult to evaluate each student for their unique contributions and nearly impossible to ensure that they share the work equally.

Col\*Lab will make it much easier for students with busy lives and differing schedules to complete projects without the challenge of scheduling in-person meetings. The discussion board and change-approval structure is intended to foster communication and cooperation between students and teachers. The system will also promote accountability because teachers would be able to see how much each student contributes to a project. Teachers, in turn, can provide more relevant and responsive feedback and address difficulties before an assignment's due date. Further, because only students will be able to create bulletin board topics, Col\*Lab would make each project student-centered and student-driven, encouraging them to take responsibility for their own learning and success.
